## 📖 Introduction
This repository serves as a structured archive for my preparation for the **PAT (Programming Ability Test) Advanced Level**. It contains solutions to algorithmic problems, optimized for performance and code readability.

Beyond passing the exam, this project aims to build a solid foundation in:
*   **Data Structures**: Trees (AVL, BST, Red-Black concepts), Graphs (Shortest Path, MST), Heaps, etc.
*   **Algorithms**: DFS/BFS, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Two Pointers.
*   **Engineering Practices**: Clean code standards, local debugging workflows, and Git version control.

## 🛠 Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate source code from build artifacts:

```text
.
├── 1001-1050/          # Problem sets grouped by ID
│   ├── 1001_A+B_Format.cpp
│   └── ...
├── Template/           # Reusable algorithm templates (Dijkstra, UnionFind, etc.)
├── bin/                # Compiled executables (Ignored by Git)
├── in.txt              # Local input buffer for redirection
└── README.md           # Documentation
